## Quantum Computing Seasons of Code	

### Important Links/Resources:

Theory:
SoS Report: [Pradipta](https://github.com/geekpradd/Quantum-Computing-SoS)   ,   [Harshit](https://github.com/HARSHIT-GUPTA-coder/quantum-computing)


Programming:
[Qiskit Learn](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html)
[Q# Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/user-guide/)


We will be dablling with both Q# and Qiskit. Qiskit Learn is a very good resource, and has everything consolidated nicely. For Q#, the docs are okayish at best. Instead I learnt it using Microsoft Q# Challenge editorials and problems.
You can find them here:
[Microsoft Q# Challenge @Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/msqs2020)

These notebooks by MnP Club are very nice:

## Deadlines

Week of 5th April: (Compulsory) Chapter 1, Chapter 2 (You can skip the mathy parts)
(Extra): Chapter 4, Chapter 5 (5.1 for now, more if you want to do)

Week of 12th April: Chapter 4, Chapter 5 (5.1, 5.3): More of Chapter 5 if you want.  

Week of 5th May: Get Started with Qiskit Learn.

Week of 12th May: Q#. 

Assignment 1: [Q# Summer 2020](https://codeforces.com/contest/1357) A1 to C2.
Deadline: Early to Late June.
This will be used for evaluation.

Week of 19th May + 26th May: Get started with coding the algorithms in qiskit/q#. And link the GUI using qiskit: Tkinter/PyQt or for Q#: C# and DotNet.
Flexible: Can be pushed to break.

Break: QML and maybe we can read some papers on QML.

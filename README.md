## Quantum Computing Seasons of Code	

### Important Links/Resources:

Theory:
[SoS Report: Pradipta](https://github.com/geekpradd/Quantum-Computing-SoS)



Programming:
[Qiskit Learn](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html)
[Q# Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/user-guide/)


We will be dablling with both Q# and Qiskit. Qiskit Learn is a very good resource, and has everything consolidated nicely. For Q#, the docs are okayish at best. Instead I learnt it using Microsoft Q# Challenge editorials and problems.
You can find them here:
[Microsoft Q# Challenge @Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/msqs2020)

These notebooks by MnP Club are very nice:
